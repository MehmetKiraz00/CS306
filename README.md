## Database Project Readme
This is a database project which aims to analyze the effects of immigration and terrorism on population in different countries. The dataset used for this project includes data from Our World in Data.

The goal of this analysis is to understand how migration and terror activities have influenced the demographic landscape across nations over recent years and examine any existing correlations between these two phenomena. Additionally, we hope that our work would ultimately provide insights into policy making towards both migration laws and terrorism prevention efforts worldwide.
