## Database Project Readme
Project Description: 

The aim of this project is to analyze the effects of immigration and terrorism on the population in different countries. The data used will include information from official site of Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/). This project seeks to determine whether or not there are any correlations between these two factors and how they affect population levels in each country studied. The analysis will be conducted using SQL queries that query a centralized database holding all relevant data for each country being analyzed. Additionally, various charts/graphs depicting trends related to immigration/terrorism may be constructed as part of visualizing results detailing potential relationships between both variables for deeper understanding into their impacts on population numbers globally. Lastly, conclusions derived from the findings should assist with recommending strategies or solutions necessary to mitigate those effects where applicable when possible.
